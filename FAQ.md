### How can I upload the matrix for a PCA or dynamic range plot, which does not require a T-test?

You can upload the basic Perseus matrix (without T-test results) under the "Volcano Plot" tab. Although an error message may appear for the volcano plot, you can proceed directly to the PCA or dynamic range plot tab and then click the "Generate Plot" button to create your desired figure.
