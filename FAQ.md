### How can I upload the matrix for a PCA or dynamic range plot, which does not require a T-test?

You can upload the basic Perseus matrix (without T-test results) under the `Volcano Plot` tab. Although an error message may appear for the volcano plot, you can proceed directly to the PCA or dynamic range plot tab and then click the `Generate Plot` button to create your desired figure.
